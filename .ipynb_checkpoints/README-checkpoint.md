# Conv all 2dCombined CNN NR-SLD Polyzwitterion-Copy1.ipynb
This code automates the training process for all 25 models of my CNN instead of having to manually change the training dataset everytime.

# Conv all 2dCombined CNN NR-SLD Polyzwitterion.ipynb
This code is used to train a singular CNN on one dataset. This is easier to moniter the progress of the CNN training process as well.

# Ionic Curve Generator
This code is used to generate training datasets for the Ionic Diblock Co-polymer.

# Poly Curve Generator-Copy1.ipynb
This code is used to generate training datasets for the Polyzwitterion Co-polymer.

#Testing multiple models combined.ipynb
This code is used to test the results of the 25 different CNN models. At the end, it has pictures of the best results.
